🔹 Finalized Workflow (Step-by-Step)
✅ 1. Farmer Health Assistant (Skin Disease Detection)
📌 Goal: Upload an image of a skin issue → Get AI-based diagnosis & remedy.
💡 Solution: Use a pre-trained skin disease model (local & free).

🔹 Steps:

Frontend (EJS): Simple form to upload an image.
Backend (Express.js): Receives image and calls Flask microservice.
AI Model: Use pre-trained MobileNet or EfficientNet for skin disease (runs locally via TensorFlow or PyTorch).
Response: AI returns the detected disease + remedies (static JSON responses).
Pre-trained Model:
🔹 ISIC 2019 Model (Skin Disease Classification) [Free]

Link: https://github.com/jeremykawahara/skin-disease-detection
Already trained on skin lesion dataset, works with Flask API for fast integration.
✅ 2. Crop Disease Detection
📌 Goal: Upload a crop image → Get disease prediction & organic treatment.
💡 Solution: Use pre-trained PlantVillage model (local & free).

🔹 Steps:

Frontend (EJS): Simple crop image upload form.
Backend (Express.js): Calls Flask API for image processing.
AI Model: Uses pre-trained ResNet (PlantVillage dataset) to detect crop disease.
Response: Returns detected disease + treatment suggestions.
Pre-trained Model:
🔹 PlantVillage ResNet Model (Crop Disease Detection) [Free]

Link: https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset
Already trained on 38 crop diseases, runs locally with PyTorch & Flask.
✅ 3. Doctor & Agriculture Expert Directory
📌 Goal: Show nearby doctors and experts for consultation.
💡 Solution: Use static MongoDB collection (no API cost).

🔹 Steps:

Frontend (EJS): Simple search bar to find doctors by district/state.
Backend (Express.js + MongoDB): Fetches doctor details.
Response: Returns contact details (phone, WhatsApp) for manual appointment.
🔹 Updated Workflow for Part 4: News & Policies
📌 Goal: Show latest updates on fertilizers, government policies, and farmer welfare schemes.
💡 Solution: Use a MongoDB collection where admins manually upload news.

🔹 Steps:

Admin Panel (EJS Form) → Allows manual entry of news articles.
MongoDB Collection → Stores news title, date, description, and category (fertilizer updates, policies, schemes, etc.).
Frontend (EJS Page) → Displays latest news articles in a scrollable feed.
Sorting & Filtering → Farmers can filter by category (e.g., “Fertilizers,” “Govt Policies”).

farmers and rural communities face significant 
challenges in accessing timely healthcare and accurate agricultural insights. Many farmers suffer from occupational health issues, particularly skin diseases caused by prolonged exposure to the sun, chemicals, and unsanitary conditions. At the same time, 
crop diseases can severely impact yield, often due to a lack of early detection and proper intervention.
