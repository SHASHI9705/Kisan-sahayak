🔹 Finalized Workflow (Step-by-Step)
✅ 1. Farmer Health Assistant (Skin Disease Detection)
📌 Goal: Upload an image of a skin issue → Get AI-based diagnosis & remedy.
💡 Solution: Use a pre-trained skin disease model (local & free).

🔹 Steps:

Frontend (EJS): Simple form to upload an image.
Backend (Express.js): Receives image and calls Flask microservice.
AI Model: Use pre-trained MobileNet or EfficientNet for skin disease (runs locally via TensorFlow or PyTorch).
Response: AI returns the detected disease + remedies (static JSON responses).
Pre-trained Model:
🔹 ISIC 2019 Model (Skin Disease Classification) [Free]

Link: https://github.com/jeremykawahara/skin-disease-detection
Already trained on skin lesion dataset, works with Flask API for fast integration.
✅ 2. Crop Disease Detection
📌 Goal: Upload a crop image → Get disease prediction & organic treatment.
💡 Solution: Use pre-trained PlantVillage model (local & free).

🔹 Steps:

Frontend (EJS): Simple crop image upload form.
Backend (Express.js): Calls Flask API for image processing.
AI Model: Uses pre-trained ResNet (PlantVillage dataset) to detect crop disease.
Response: Returns detected disease + treatment suggestions.
Pre-trained Model:
🔹 PlantVillage ResNet Model (Crop Disease Detection) [Free]

Link: https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset
Already trained on 38 crop diseases, runs locally with PyTorch & Flask.
✅ 3. Doctor & Agriculture Expert Directory
📌 Goal: Show nearby doctors and experts for consultation.
💡 Solution: Use static MongoDB collection (no API cost).

🔹 Steps:

Frontend (EJS): Simple search bar to find doctors by district/state.
Backend (Express.js + MongoDB): Fetches doctor details.
Response: Returns contact details (phone, WhatsApp) for manual appointment.
🔹 Updated Workflow for Part 4: News & Policies
📌 Goal: Show latest updates on fertilizers, government policies, and farmer welfare schemes.
💡 Solution: Use a MongoDB collection where admins manually upload news.

🔹 Steps:

Admin Panel (EJS Form) → Allows manual entry of news articles.
MongoDB Collection → Stores news title, date, description, and category (fertilizer updates, policies, schemes, etc.).
Frontend (EJS Page) → Displays latest news articles in a scrollable feed.
Sorting & Filtering → Farmers can filter by category (e.g., “Fertilizers,” “Govt Policies”).
